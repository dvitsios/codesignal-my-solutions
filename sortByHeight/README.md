Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.

**Example**

For `a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]`, the output should be
`sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]`.
