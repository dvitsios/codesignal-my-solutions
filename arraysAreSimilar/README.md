Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays `a` and `b`, check whether they are similar.

**Example**

* For `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be
    `areSimilar(a, b) = true`.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

* For `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [2, 1, 3]`, the output should be
    `areSimilar(a, b) = true`.

We can obtain `b` from `a` by swapping `2` and `1` in `b`.

* For `a = [1, 2, 2]` and `b = [2, 1, 1]`, the output should be
    `areSimilar(a, b) = false`.

Any swap of any two elements either in `a` or in `b` won't make `a` and `b` equal.
