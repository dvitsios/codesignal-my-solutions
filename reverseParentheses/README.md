You have a string `s` that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. It is guaranteed that the parentheses in `s` form a regular bracket sequence.

Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. The results string should not contain any parentheses.

**Example**

For string `s = "a(bc)de"`, the output should be
`reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde"`.
