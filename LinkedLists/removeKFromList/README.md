Given a singly linked list of integers `l` and an integer `k`, remove all elements from list `l` that have a value equal to `k`.

**Example**

 * For `l = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be
   `removeKFromList(l, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5]`;

 * For `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 10`, the output should be
   `removeKFromList(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
