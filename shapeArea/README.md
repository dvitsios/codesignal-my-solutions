Below we will define an `n`-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given `n`.

A `1`-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length `1`. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the `n - 1`-interesting polygon and appending `1`-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the `1`-, `2`-, `3`- and `4`-interesting polygons in the picture below.

**Example**

* For `n = 2`, the output should be
    `shapeArea(n) = 5`
* For `n = 3`, the output should be
    `shapeArea(n) = 13`
