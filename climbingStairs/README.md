You are climbing a staircase that has `n` steps. You can take the steps either `1` or `2` at a time. Calculate how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

**Example**

For `n = 1`, the output should be
`climbingStairs(n) = 1`;

For `n = 2`, the output should be
`climbingStairs(n) = 2`.

You can either climb `2` steps at once or climb `1` step two times.
