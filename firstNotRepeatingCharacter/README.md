Given a string `s`, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return `'_'`.

**Example**

* For `s = "abacabad"`, the output should be
    `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'`.

There are `2` non-repeating characters in the string: `'c'` and `'d'`. Return c since it appears in the string first.

* For `s = "abacabaabacaba"`, the output should be
    `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'`.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.
